Eh whatever, LET'S ESCAPE!\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f GAME CONTAINS JUMPSCARES AND LOUD NOISES \u26a0\ufe0f\r\n\r\nCan you escape Mr. Crazy and make it to stage 21 of this obby / parkour? He will be chasing you!\r\n\r\nFinished easy mode? Try hard mode!\r\n\r\nIf you had fun playing this obby I'd be so appreciative if you were to leave a \ud83d\udc4d and favorite, \u2764\ufe0f.\r\n\r\nIf you're stuck on a stage make sure to check out some of the fun power-ups in the shop, any purchases are greatly appreciated and support me in making future games but don't feel pressured, simply playing the game is just as meaningful to me as a developer \u2764\ufe0f. Have fun!\r\n\r\nJoin the Decent Obbies group if you don't want to miss out on future obby games!",
